I am thinking to use `Daniel Defoe's` book - my favourite novel,[Robinson Crusoe](https://mika215.github.io/homepage-michael/blogs.html).
If you like the story you are welcome to collaborate in building up the full stroy. 
Hold on! i would like o appologize for the messy text i have used in the link attached above(the content of the story) - i had published the story in my "Fake-Blog" when i was not knowing much about CSS.

Let's Go!
